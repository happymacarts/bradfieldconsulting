			<h1>Our Team</h1>

			<p>Bradfield Consulting, Inc. was started in 2012 by Joseph and Ana Bradfield. Joseph has over {{ Date('Y') - 1995}}  years experience and knowledge in the graphic arts and web coding industry and Ana has over {{ Date('Y') - 1995}}  years experience as a Job Costing Accountant and Project Coordinator in the Construction Industry. Initially Bradfield Consulting, Inc. was developed to bring web based solutions to small businesses with limited resources. Over time as the Temecula Valley grew, Ana noticed another need&hellip; Accountants. 
			</p>
			<p>
			There seemed to be a disconnect between the Tax Preparer or CPA and the Bookkeeper which was causing thousands of dollars to be missed in deductions in local business taxes. After this discovery, Ana set out to help small businesses understand their financials and to not fear the IRS. By sitting with business owners and reviewing their final Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet prior to the Tax Preparer, Bradfield Consulting, Inc. has been able to help small business owners save thousands, not just in taxes, but in overall Financial Management & Health of their company. 
			</p>
			<p> 
			After five years of working full time and managing Bradfield Consulting, Inc. part time, Ana could no longer keep up with the needs of the business and quit her full time job in August of 2017 to become a full time Consultant while her husband Joseph continued his career as a Web Developer at a local University of California.
			</p>
			<p>
			For Ana, the goal at the end of the day is to secure the small business ownerâ€™s mind so that they know and understand EXACTLY what it costs to run their business along with educating them on basic understandings and knowledge of IRS qualified business expenses. Bradfield Consulting, Inc. keeps the pulse on each of their clients by meeting with them weekly, bi-weekly or monthly so there are no misunderstandings in the clients financials. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In addition to educating our clients, Bradfield Consulting, Inc. is dedicated to networking with only the best and brightest professionals in the Valley. In March of 2019 Bradfield Consulting, Inc. became a Founding Member of Business Networking International (BNI) - Temecula Business Uncorked.
